# Personal Portfolio Challenge

I built a [responsive portfolio website](https://mata-repo.vercel.app/) using **Node.js**, **TypeScript + React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Three.js**.  
The site showcases my work and skills with three main sections:

- Home - Introduction and bio section  
- Projects - Highlighting my work and GitHub repositories  
- Contact - Contact form w/ confirmation and easy ways to reach me  

## Features
- [x] Built using HTML + CSS + JavaScript or a modern stack (React, Vue, Laravel, etc.)  
- [x] Responsive design (works well on mobile and desktop)  
- [x] Clean, organized layout (Flexbox/Grid or CSS framework)  
- [x] Smooth navigation between sections or pages  

## Bonus Content
- [x] Dark mode toggle  
- [x] Fetch GitHub repos dynamically from GitHub API  
- [x] Animations (scroll fade-ins, hover effects, interactive Three.js elements)  
- [x] Deployed online using Vercel
